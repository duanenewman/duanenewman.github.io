      <description>Living in the Xamarin mobile development trenches? Then you have probably created or at least thought about a few cross-platform aids. Sharing that platform agnostic code with new projects is easy, but things can get tricky with platform-specific implementations, right? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be great if you could manage and maintain that functionality in reusable packages? We&amp;rsquo;ll explore how to structure your projects and configure a single NuGet package to install shared and platform libraries.</description>

      <description>Inspired by everything from Star Trek to the Tesla car, I&amp;rsquo;ve embarked on a journey to transform my truck from mundane to something that is more than meets the eye. Ever since I was old enough to drive, I&amp;rsquo;ve dreamed of having a car with a computerized dashboard, but it seemed out of reach until recently. With the advent of affordable tiny embedded computers like the Arduino and Raspberry Pi I was finally ready to make this a reality.</description>

      <description>Testing your mobile app against the sea of mobile devices can be daunting, and even limiting to testing with recent popular devices can be cumbersome and expensive. Not to mention the wear and tear on your thumbs with all that tapping and swiping! Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be great if you could apply your well-honed app logic unit testing skills and practices to your UI testing? I&amp;rsquo;ve got great news, you can!</description>

      <description>Whether you are creating an open source library or building enterprise app core components, you need to get that functionality into other projects. But developing these resources is usually easier than consuming them. How about a worry free way to distribute and reference those resources in your project that will let you stay up to date, but allow you to avoid problems that may introduce breaking changes or new bugs?</description>

      <description>Working with delegates in C# is easier than ever with .NET&amp;rsquo;s generic Action and Func types. Understanding .NET delegates is key to harnessing the power of language features like Lambdas and LINQ. In this session, we&amp;rsquo;ll dig into delegates, exploring what they are, how they work, and how they can help you be a SOLID developer. Don&amp;rsquo;t let delegates put you in a Func, take Action, and learn how to make your code simpler, cleaner, and more flexible.</description>
