      <description>Another Nebraska.Code() is in the books and it was a real blast. The organizers, Adam &amp;amp; Ken, really put in the effort and run a great conference. The other speakers are always quality company and I really enjoyed meeting a few new ones and getting to know some much better. One of the things I enjoy about conference is the circle of friends you make and meet across the country as you travel to this conference and that conference.</description>

      <description>I hate it when I find a blog post draft that I forgot to post for *weeks*, it’s a little late, but here are some of my impressions from Microsoft’s Build conference this year.
This year&#39;s build was pretty exciting for .NET developers. With strong progress around the Windows platform and major announcements in the mobile developer space. Build was an fun experience and I was able to both reconnect with friends I&#39;ve made on the conference circuit and meet a lot of new faces.</description>

      <description>I had a little time today to work on Bluff, my extension for Sony Vegas Pro. Over the last couple weeks I’ve done several things to the project, including:
 Converting the project to .NET 3.5 (from 2.0)  Converting the UI to WPF (still a little cleanup to do on that UI, but it is a lot easier to work with now)  Add a new command called Arrange Events By Created Timestamp that spaces the events out on the timeline relative to each others created timestamp  Changed the Vegas DLL reference to a v8 dll (to provide better compatibility form Vegas Pro 8 – 13)  And last, but not least, I added a WIX based installer to the project   If you just want grab the latest version jump over to the GitHub release page.</description>

      <title>Bluff: An OSS Extension for Sony Vegas Pro</title>

      <description>Yesterday, my business Alien Arc Technologies, LLC announced the release of version 1.0 of an open source project I’ve been tinkering on recently, called Bluff. This is my first OSS project and I’m excited to have created something that I hope others will find useful, and better yet, will contribute their own ideas to.
History The project came out of my own personal needs and interest. In 2015 I was introduced to the world of scuba diving and I’ve fallen totally in love with it.</description>
