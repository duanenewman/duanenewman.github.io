      <description>I had a little time today to work on Bluff, my extension for Sony Vegas Pro. Over the last couple weeks I’ve done several things to the project, including:
 Converting the project to .NET 3.5 (from 2.0)  Converting the UI to WPF (still a little cleanup to do on that UI, but it is a lot easier to work with now)  Add a new command called Arrange Events By Created Timestamp that spaces the events out on the timeline relative to each others created timestamp  Changed the Vegas DLL reference to a v8 dll (to provide better compatibility form Vegas Pro 8 – 13)  And last, but not least, I added a WIX based installer to the project   If you just want grab the latest version jump over to the GitHub release page.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, my business Alien Arc Technologies, LLC announced the release of version 1.0 of an open source project I’ve been tinkering on recently, called Bluff. This is my first OSS project and I’m excited to have created something that I hope others will find useful, and better yet, will contribute their own ideas to.
History The project came out of my own personal needs and interest. In 2015 I was introduced to the world of scuba diving and I’ve fallen totally in love with it.</description>
