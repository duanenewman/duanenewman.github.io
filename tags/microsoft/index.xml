      <description>A couple weeks ago I went to my first MVP Summit. The MVP program is a way that Microsoft recognizes &amp;ldquo;technology experts who passionately share their knowledge with the community&amp;rdquo;*. There are several perks to being an MVP. While many may immediately think of the compliemntary MSDN subscription and software licenses from other vendors, I was most excited about the opportunity to go to MVP Summit. As an MVP (under tight NDA) I am able to meet over skype with the various product teams at MS to get a view into where they are headed with thier technologies.</description>
