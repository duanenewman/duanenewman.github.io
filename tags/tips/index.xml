      <title>Parallels Shared Network Fails to Connect</title>

      <description>Today (Monday), out of the blue, one of my Windows 10 Parallels virtual machines decided that it had no connection to the internet. Friday I was on site at a client using their WiFi network to work through some changes they needed. Today, back at the office, I fired up my VM to push the changes and make a couple more tweaks. I was immediately greeted by git telling me that my git host didn&amp;rsquo;t exist.</description>

      <title>Forcing a Specific Target Platform With PackageReference</title>

      <description>In my last post about Using Prism with Xamarin.Forms &amp;amp; GTK# I showed how to force the use of .NET Standard reference when using NuGet with packages.config. You may prefer using the &amp;lt;PackageReference&amp;gt; tag in your csproj and found that those changes do not work for your scenario. This post will show you how to achieve the same override with PackageReference based projects.&#xA;Using Package Reference If you already have packages installed and are using a packages.</description>

      <title>Concurrent Reads and Locked Writes with In-Memory Objects</title>

      <description>The Problem On a recent project one of our clients had implemented an in-memory cache of some high read, low write data. The ultimate solution they had was a List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; that they could search against while periodically updating when the database was updated. The reads worked great and were incredibly fast. The trouble came when they started to implement the updates. This was in their API layer and so incoming calls were on multiple threads.</description>

      <title>Better Unit Testing with IoC, DI, and Mocking</title>

      <description>When you write code designed for dependency injection it can make testing easier.. But it can also make it seem more complex and add a lot of ceremony to creating your testable instances. I thought I would share some tips I use when setting up a new cross-platform mobile project with unit testing. We can take advantage of the same IoC container strategy to make instantiating the class we want to test less painful.</description>

      <description>Extension methods are a great way to add functionality or integration for established types. Learn about some of the cool things that you can do without the need to subclass or modify a class directly. You can even use extension methods to supply specialized functionality that is only relevant in a particular situation or when also making use of another type or library. We&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at a few quick tricks and explore how you can get started with Extension Methods today.</description>

      <title>Diving in Bonaire - 2016</title>

      <description>I decided to take a few minutes and reflect on my recent trip to Bonaire and share some accomplishments and observations. To begin with, the flight there is long. We had two options, 45 minute layover to catch an international flight with all our luggage, or 5 hour layover waiting in the airport. We chose the later since no on wanted to miss a flight that only happens once a day and only on Saturday and Sunday each week.</description>

      <description>Traveling with your photography equipment can be challenging when you are taking all your pictures on dry (or at least solid) ground. Add all the equipment you need if you are going to get wet with you camera and it becomes a production just getting it all to your destination. When I first looked into what to do I had a hard time finding information on what other were doing, so I hope you find this helpful as you plan your underwater photography dive trip.</description>

      <title>Merging GoPro Segments Into a Single File</title>
      <link>https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/merging-gopro-segments-into-a-single-file/</link>

      <description>If you have ever done a long recording with your GoPro you know that you will end up with several ~4GB files instead of a single video file. This can be very inconvenient if you just want to be able to watch the video start to finish, or if you want to apply effects (like de-shaker) across a file boundary.&#xA;If you are not familiar with file systems this may seem odd, but it is a well known limitation of the FAT file system which the GoPro, and many other small electronics, use for file storage.</description>

      <title>Generating Authenticator QR Codes</title>

      <description>I’ve taken to saving my Authenticator secrets so that I can recover from a lost, damaged or replaced phone with less pain. After actually replacing a phone and having to re-enter all my codes I decided there was a better way then pecking on the phone’s keyboard one letter at a time. I thought that they deliver them to me as a QR code I can scan in the first place, surely I can generate my own to speed up the process.</description>

      <description>I’m working on a demo app to show some simple functionality that can be done with Xamarin Forms. I’m using the opportunity to also make a business card app for myself (and ultimately for Alien Arc). The app has my picture, name, short bio, and other relevant information. This also seemed like a good place to tie in some of my various social network feeds. I quickly added a page that pulls my blog RSS feed and lists my recent posts.</description>

      <title>Lessons Learned from My First Speaking Experience</title>
      <link>https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/lessons-learned-from-my-first-speaking-experience/</link>

      <guid>https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/lessons-learned-from-my-first-speaking-experience/</guid>
      <description>First off, speaking is a rush. It is hard to describe the feeling just after completing a talk. I had to move around, talk to people, see what was going on; it really energized me. I am definitely going to continue to pursue future speaking opportunities as they present themselves, and I’ll keep you posted when they get accepted.&#xA;As I mentioned in previous posts, my first talk was on Xamarin Forms, a new technology in a toolset that we are using at Alien Arc, but that is still new to us.</description>

      <title>Why doesn’t my code work in Xamarin.Forms?</title>

      <description>If you have tried something in Xamarin.Forms that should work but didn&amp;rsquo;t, don&amp;rsquo;t worry you might not be going crazy (I can&amp;rsquo;t say for sure, I&amp;rsquo;m a programmer, not a psychologist).&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve been diving deeper into Xamarin.Forms over the last couple months while working on a small project we have as well as in preparation for my upcoming talk at St. Louis Days of .NET. Sometimes in the course of creating a sample project I write some code that I know should work and then watch the exceptions pop-up (or worse, see nothing at all) when I run it.</description>
