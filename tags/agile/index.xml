      <description>This was my first year speaking at the Heartland Developers Conference in Omaha, although I’ve attended many times through the years as an attendee. The experience was quite a lot of fun, and I had a good time hanging out with old friends and making a few new ones. My wife came with me and good time watching all of us “geeks” hangout. This was the first time doing a new talk, and the first talk that didn’t involve any demo’s, and it was not scheduled until Friday morning.</description>
