      <title>Using Prism With Xamarin.Forms &amp; GTK</title>
      <link>https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/using-prism-with-xamarin-forms-and-gtk/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m working on project to replace my car radio with a custom digital dashboard. I&amp;rsquo;m building it on a RaspberryPi and would really like to use Xamarin.Forms and Prism, so I started out with adding a GTK# frontend to my Xamarin.Forms project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adding-the-gtk-backend-project&#34;&gt;Adding the GTK# Backend Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we can add the GTK# project we need to actually install the GTK# libraries. Head over to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-win&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Mono Project&lt;/a&gt; to download and run the GTK# for .NET installer for Windows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Keeping Observable Collections Up To Date</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the powerful capabilities we&amp;rsquo;ve learned to leverage when using the MVVM pattern for XAML based apps, whether for the desktop or mobile platforms, is data binding. Binding allows us to easily keep our View up to date with changes in the ViewModel. These bindings are typically pretty quick when not abused, but there are situations where they can become less than performant, causing visual anomalies such as flickering or even impacting general app performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My First MVP Summit</title>
      <link>https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/my-first-mvp-summit/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/my-first-mvp-summit/</guid>
      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;img-thumbnail pull-left&#34; src=&#34;microsoftsign.png&#34; alt=&#34;Me at the Microsoft Sign&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;
A couple weeks ago I went to my first MVP Summit. The MVP program is a way that Microsoft recognizes &#34;technology experts who passionately share their knowledge with the community&#34;[*](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/Overview). There are several perks to being an MVP. While many may immediately think of the compliemntary MSDN subscription and software licenses from other vendors, I was most excited about the opportunity to go to MVP Summit. As an MVP (under tight NDA) I am able to meet over skype with the various product teams at MS to get a view into where they are headed with thier technologies. This is invaluable as a consultant tring to stear my customers in the best direction and as a speaker shaping my future presentations.
&lt;img class=&#34;img-thumbnail pull-right&#34; src=&#34;mvplookslike.png&#34; alt=&#34;This is What an MVP Looks Like&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;
These skype meetings are great, but once a year Micorosoft puts on the MVP Summit and brings in thousands of MVPs to Redmond for in-person sessions with the developers creating the tools I use every day. As a speaker I approach most conferences differently than I used to. I often don&#39;t get to sessions as I&#39;m either prepping for my own or I&#39;ve ran into a friend in the hallway and we get busy catching up or having our own technology conversations. It is great, but I do sometimes miss the opportunity to just hop from session to session gleaning the information from the speaker without the stress of presenting. Well, MVP Summit allowed me to do just that: be an attendee again, and it was really cool.
&lt;img class=&#34;img-thumbnail pull-left&#34; src=&#34;FirstMvpLanyard.png&#34; alt=&#34;My First MVP Lanyard&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; /&gt;
One of the things that stuck out the most to me at MVP Summit was the willingness that the teams had to get feedback. As a developer I can totally understand it, and I always hope for good feedback from users so that I can improve, but it just surprised me to see that same interest from Microsoft. It was a treat to get to meet most of the Xamarin PMs while I there, and one of the best sessions I went to was a panel discussion with all of them, including Miguel. I was impressed with how they reacted and replied when questions were asked about what the teams were doing (especially with critical feedback). It was cool getting straight answers on why a feature is (or isn&#39;t) being implemented with explanations of what they&#39;ve tried, rather than just being told it isn&#39;t happening. At one point when a new feature was being talked about and one of the MVPs raised a question that the team had not considered the PM polled the room for our opinion on what would be most useful and when he saw that it was for the oposite aproach they were taking there was real interest in making changes. 
&lt;p&gt;I also had a great oportunity to see friends I usually just see when we are speaking at the same conference as well as meet many new friends. It was cool getting to have face-to-face encounters with some of the &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; names in the developer community. The networking was fantastic, and I look forward to seeing many of the other MVPs and MS employees again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=&#34;http://nebraskacode.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Nebraska.Code()&lt;/a&gt; is in the books and it was a real blast. The organizers, Adam &amp;amp; Ken, really put in the effort and run a great conference. The other speakers are always quality company and I really enjoyed meeting a few new ones and getting to know some much better. One of the things I enjoy about conference is the circle of friends you make and meet across the country as you travel to this conference and that conference. We had lots of deep, and many more entertaining conversations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I hate it when I find a blog post draft that I forgot to post for *weeks*, it’s a little late, but here are some of my impressions from Microsoft’s Build conference this year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This year&#39;s build was pretty exciting for .NET developers. With strong progress around the Windows platform and major announcements in the mobile developer space. Build was an fun experience and I was able to both reconnect with friends I&#39;ve made on the conference circuit and meet a lot of new faces. Here are some of my reactions to the announcements, activities, and experience of the Build 2016 day one keynote.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was out of active Xamarin development for a couple months and recently wanted to jump back in and work on a couple new project ideas. I fired up VS2015 and created a project. It was then that I realized I had not installed the official Xamarin tools since I got my new Surface Book. So I decided it was a good idea to install that latest Xamarin Tools before I did anything else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Kansas City Developers Conference 2015 Recap</title>
      <link>https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/kcdc-2015-recap/</link>

      <guid>https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/kcdc-2015-recap/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In preparation for my fall conference lineup I thought I would take a minute to reflect on this year’s Kansas City Developers Conference. Once again, I am impressed with the quality of conference that the KCDC crew puts together. Kudos go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/boontlee&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Boone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jonathanfmills&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/leebrandt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Lee&lt;/a&gt; for nurturing a small weekend event into what is, today, one of the top conferences in the Midwest for developers (of any discipline). I’ve had the opportunity to go to some of the “BIG” (and expensive) developer conferences out there and experience what they feel like, and to me KCDC has that same polished feel of conferences that cost 10x as much to attend. It is great to be able to attend a developer conference of that caliber without ever leaving town.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;KCDC is just a week away and I&#39;m busy updating my materials. I&#39;m looking forward to meeting some great developers and catching up with what is quickly becoming a close group of speaker friends.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be presenting my Xamarin.Forms talk on Thursday morning at 10:10 AM. Conference mornings are always a little rough, but I like getting the talk done early, then I get to relax, network, and enjoy seeing my friends presenting their talks. If you are looking at doing mobile development and have a solid C# background then I encourage you to attend my session.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in November 2014 at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://stldodn.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;St. Louis Days of .NET&lt;/a&gt; conference I sat down with JJ Hammond from &lt;a href=&#34;http://stltechtalk.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;STL Tech Talk&lt;/a&gt; for an interview. It was a lot of fun and I had a great time talking about Xamarin, Xamarin.Forms, and mobile development for the C# developer. It got lost somewhere among all the other interview videos, but thanks to Kevin and JJ it is was found and is now posted for your viewing pleasure. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was a pleasure to attend and speak at Nebraska.Code() this year. The guys in Lincoln are great and really put on a good conference. One of the neat parts of being a speaker is getting to know a lot of other great speakers as you go from one conference to another together. I&#39;ve found that as soon as one conference is over I&#39;m looking forward to the next one and the chance to hang out with the gang.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Xamarin Forms Windows Phone Deployment Tip #1</title>
      <link>https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/xamarin-forms-windows-phone-deployment-tip-1/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a helpful tip if you are developing a mobile app using Xamarin Forms and targeting Windows Phone 8.0 (or if you are just writing a WP8.0 Silverlight based app). If you are ready to deploy and filling everything out online it is easier than it first seems. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the Windows Phone Dev Center you will find a helpful link to &lt;a href=&#34;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn655122(v=vs.105).aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; telling you to add some info to the Package.appxmanifest.xml file. Only when you look at your project the file doesn’t exist. Searching will turn up little in the way of useful information. The problem is that these instructions are for Windows Phone Silverlight 8.1, which added the Package.appxmanifest.xml file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Getting your brand’s Twitter timeline in your mobile app</title>
      <link>https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/getting-your-brands-twitter-timeline-in-your-mobile-app/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m working on a demo app to show some simple functionality that can be done with Xamarin Forms. I’m using the opportunity to also make a business card app for myself (and ultimately for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alienarc.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Alien Arc&lt;/a&gt;). The app has my picture, name, short bio, and other relevant information. This also seemed like a good place to tie in some of my various social network feeds. I quickly added a page that pulls my blog RSS feed and lists my recent posts. That went really quick and next on my list was to load my twitter timeline and show recent tweets. The blog was so easy and quick to do that I thought it would take no time to get twitter integrated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lessons Learned from My First Speaking Experience</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First off, speaking is a rush. It is hard to describe the feeling just after completing a talk. I had to move around, talk to people, see what was going on; it really energized me. I am definitely going to continue to pursue future speaking opportunities as they present themselves, and I’ll keep you posted when they get accepted.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://duanenewman.net/img/posts/OS7A6321_1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img title=&#34;OS7A6321&#34; style=&#34;border-left-width: 0px; max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-right-width: 0px; width: 100%; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;OS7A6321&#34; src=&#34;https://duanenewman.net/img/posts/OS7A6321_thumb_1.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why doesn’t my code work in Xamarin.Forms?</title>
      <link>https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/why-doesnt-my-code-work-in-xamarinforms/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have tried something in Xamarin.Forms that should work but didn&amp;rsquo;t, don&amp;rsquo;t worry you might not be going crazy (I can&amp;rsquo;t say for sure, I&amp;rsquo;m a programmer, not a psychologist).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been diving deeper into Xamarin.Forms over the last couple months while working on a small project we have as well as in preparation for my upcoming talk at St. Louis Days of .NET. &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes in the course of creating a sample project I write some code that I know should work and then watch the exceptions pop-up (or worse, see nothing at all) when I run it. Then I go do a quick search and find that this is a known issue&amp;hellip; and that it has been fixed. That is when I remember that I didn&amp;rsquo;t update my Xamarin.Forms nuget packages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been wanting to start speaking at conferences for a while now, but have always been nervous about it. I’ve really wanted to do this for a long time but I specifically remember in 2013 I went to KCDC and was all energized about sharing as a speaker. I decided that I was going to work on having a presentation for the next year. When KCDC 2014 was announced earlier this year I realized I hadn’t even thought about a topic since the week after last years conference. I was a little bummed by my lack of effort, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
