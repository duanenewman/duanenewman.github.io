      <description>I just picked up my Surface Pro from my local Microsoft Store this morning. I&amp;rsquo;m no stranger to Windows 8; I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it on my desktop since RTM (and a little before) and I bought the RT back on launch day. In general I like the changes that have been made and no longer feel at home on Windows 7. I have especially been digging the way the interface was built around touch with my RT, I think that has helped me accept some of the changes experienced with mouse and keyboard only input.</description>
