I was really impressed with the skill that some of these students (all with less than a year of experience) had. The quality of some of the code they wrote really surprised me.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It was a really enjoyable experience and I was happy to be able to get more involved in the community with the next generation of coders. I look forward to other opportunities to work with the future of software development and technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
