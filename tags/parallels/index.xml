      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today (Monday), out of the blue, one of my Windows 10 Parallels virtual machines decided that it had no connection to the internet. Friday I was on site at a client using their WiFi network to work through some changes they needed. Today, back at the office, I fired up my VM to push the changes and make a couple more tweaks. I was immediately greeted by git telling me that my git host didn&amp;rsquo;t exist. I realized that Windows was reporting that I had no internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
