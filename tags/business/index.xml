      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m working on a demo app to show some simple functionality that can be done with Xamarin Forms. I’m using the opportunity to also make a business card app for myself (and ultimately for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alienarc.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Alien Arc&lt;/a&gt;). The app has my picture, name, short bio, and other relevant information. This also seemed like a good place to tie in some of my various social network feeds. I quickly added a page that pulls my blog RSS feed and lists my recent posts. That went really quick and next on my list was to load my twitter timeline and show recent tweets. The blog was so easy and quick to do that I thought it would take no time to get twitter integrated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Making Progress on Your Small Business Goals</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Brent and I started Alien Arc we had a few basic goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To have more flexible working conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be more active with the developer community and conferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create our own products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve done a pretty good job in our first 6 months getting started on some of these goals. We are on-site with our primary client, but they are closer and with the consultant relationship it is much easier to deal with any needs for a flexible schedule.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
