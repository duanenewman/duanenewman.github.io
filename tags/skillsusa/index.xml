      <description>On Saturday I had an opportunity to be involved in a SkillsUSA district competition as a judge for the coding competition. I was really impressed with the skill that some of these students (all with less than a year of experience) had. The quality of some of the code they wrote really surprised me.
It was a really enjoyable experience and I was happy to be able to get more involved in the community with the next generation of coders.</description>
