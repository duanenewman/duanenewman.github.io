      <description>I recently encountered some authentication issues connecting my Mac to the package service hosted on a client&amp;rsquo;s on-prem TFS server. The server is on a Windows domain and normally I access TFS from a windows VM that is joined to the domain. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve recently found myself on my Mac more often while working on one of their Xamarin mobile apps. This is when I began having problems.
The Problem The client has a couple NuGet packages hosted on the TFS server using the Package Management extension, and whenever I tried to do a NuGet restore I would run into authentication errors.</description>
