      <title>Basic Authentication with TFS Package Server</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently encountered some authentication issues connecting my Mac to the package service hosted on a client&amp;rsquo;s on-prem TFS server. The server is on a Windows domain and normally I access TFS from a windows VM that is joined to the domain. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve recently found myself on my Mac more often while working on one of their Xamarin mobile apps. This is when I began having problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The client has a couple NuGet packages hosted on the TFS server using the Package Management extension, and whenever I tried to do a NuGet restore I would run into authentication errors. I tried my normal domain user &amp;amp; password as well as a Personal Access Token (the method I wanted to use) and consistently was told my credentials were no good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Better Way to Override References With PackageReference</title>
      <link>https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/a-better-way-to-override-references-with-packagereference/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, there was a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6949&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;new feature added&lt;/a&gt; to msbuild (working in Visual Studio 2019 15.9.9) that generates a variable for each package that contains the full path to the package version being used. All you have to do is add an attribute to each &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;PackageReference&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; you want need to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are just two changes to what we did &lt;a href=&#34;https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/forcing-a-specific-target-platform-with-packagereference&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;GeneratePathProperty&lt;/code&gt; attribute to &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;PackageReference&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch to &lt;code&gt;Pkg&amp;lt;Package_Name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; variable in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;HintPath&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step one is pretty simple, add the attribute &lt;code&gt;GeneratePathProperty&lt;/code&gt; with a value of &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Forcing a Specific Target Platform With PackageReference</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my last post about &lt;a href=&#34;../using-prism-with-xamarin-forms-and-gtk&#34;&gt;Using Prism with Xamarin.Forms &amp;amp; GTK#&lt;/a&gt; I showed how to force the use of .NET Standard reference when using NuGet with packages.config. You may prefer using the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;PackageReference&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag in your csproj and found that those changes do not work for your scenario. This post will show you how to achieve the same override with PackageReference based projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-package-reference&#34;&gt;Using Package Reference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;convertconfigtoreference2.png&#34; class=&#34;img-thumbnail pull-right&#34; alt=&#34;Convert Packages.config to PackageReference&#34; /&gt; If you already have packages installed and are using a &lt;code&gt;packages.config&lt;/code&gt; file then you will need to convert your project to use &lt;code&gt;PackageReference&lt;/code&gt;. You can follow the steps here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/migrate-packages-config-to-package-reference&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Migrate from packages.config to PackageReference&lt;/a&gt;. The short version is to right-click on &lt;code&gt;packages.config&lt;/code&gt; and select &lt;code&gt;Migrate Packages.config to PackageReference...&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Prism With Xamarin.Forms &amp; GTK</title>
      <link>https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/using-prism-with-xamarin-forms-and-gtk/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m working on project to replace my car radio with a custom digital dashboard. I&amp;rsquo;m building it on a RaspberryPi and would really like to use Xamarin.Forms and Prism, so I started out with adding a GTK# frontend to my Xamarin.Forms project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adding-the-gtk-backend-project&#34;&gt;Adding the GTK# Backend Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we can add the GTK# project we need to actually install the GTK# libraries. Head over to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-win&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Mono Project&lt;/a&gt; to download and run the GTK# for .NET installer for Windows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Running PowerShell Scripts From C#</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the little things can trip up your code, even when you think you are doing all the right things. We recently ran into an issue with a utility that runs an included PowerShell script as part of it operation. When the app was first put into use it seemed to be fine. Recently, it was deployed into a folder with spaces in the name and it began to blow up. Here is a simplified example of what it was running:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Concurrent Reads and Locked Writes with In-Memory Objects</title>
      <link>https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/concurrent-reads-and-locked-writes-with-in-memory-objects/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a recent project one of our clients had implemented an in-memory cache of some high read, low write data. The ultimate solution they had was a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that they could search against while periodically updating when the database was updated. The reads worked great and were incredibly fast. The trouble came when they started to implement the updates. This was in their API layer and so incoming calls were on multiple threads. The multi-threading was perfect for reading, but as soon as they started updating the collection (or any sub-collections on the individual items involved in queries) they, unsurprisingly, started getting &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.invalidoperationexception&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;InvalidOperationExceptions&lt;/a&gt; with the message &amp;ldquo;Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Keeping Observable Collections Up To Date</title>
      <link>https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/keeping-observable-collections-up-to-date/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the powerful capabilities we&amp;rsquo;ve learned to leverage when using the MVVM pattern for XAML based apps, whether for the desktop or mobile platforms, is data binding. Binding allows us to easily keep our View up to date with changes in the ViewModel. These bindings are typically pretty quick when not abused, but there are situations where they can become less than performant, causing visual anomalies such as flickering or even impacting general app performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Better Unit Testing with IoC, DI, and Mocking</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you write code designed for dependency injection it can make testing easier.. But it can also make it seem more complex and add a lot of ceremony to creating your testable instances. I thought I would share some tips I use when setting up a new cross-platform mobile project with unit testing. We can take advantage of the same IoC container strategy to make instantiating the class we want to test less painful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Teach an old Type new tricks with Extension Methods</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Extension methods are a great way to add functionality or integration for established types. Learn about some of the cool things that you can do without the need to subclass or modify a class directly. You can even use extension methods to supply specialized functionality that is only relevant in a particular situation or when also making use of another type or library. We&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at a few quick tricks and explore how you can get started with Extension Methods today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>All I want for Christmas is a C# Build System</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-so-jolly&#34;&gt;Why So Jolly?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://crosscuttingconcerns.com/The-First-C-Advent-Calendar&#34;&gt;The First C# Advent Calendar&lt;/a&gt;, celebrating all things C#. After you finish here check out the other great posts in the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-c-build-system&#34;&gt;A C# Build System&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used many tools over the years to manage builds of large .NET projects including custom BAT/CMD files, customer PowerShell scripts, NAnt, and of course MSBuild. While I&amp;rsquo;ve been happy with the solutions I provided with each of these I&amp;rsquo;ve always found them either awkward to extend or limiting in their extensibility and more recently I needed them to work on a Mac for building Xamarin projects. In the hunt to find something that would work outside of Windows I discovered &lt;a href=&#34;https://cakebuild.net/&#34;&gt;Cake&lt;/a&gt;, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
