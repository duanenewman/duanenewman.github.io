      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today (Monday), out of the blue, one of my Windows 10 Parallels virtual machines decided that it had no connection to the internet. Friday I was on site at a client using their WiFi network to work through some changes they needed. Today, back at the office, I fired up my VM to push the changes and make a couple more tweaks. I was immediately greeted by git telling me that my git host didn&amp;rsquo;t exist. I realized that Windows was reporting that I had no internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently built a custom FreeNAS file server in my house to act as high capacity storage for my personal photos &amp;amp; videos, a Plex Media Server, and an S3 server for offsite backup for my business and family, among a few other minor things. At the same time I also replaced my Ubiquiti EdgeRouter X with a custom pfSense router (primarily for better remote VPN and P2P VPN support).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
