      <description>In my day job I work on a product that does a lot of video work and in fact has a custom DirectShow player that gets all our video into WPF. &amp;nbsp;It plays multiple files all synchronized (a real challenge).
While looking into ways to improve performance I found myself needing to see how my filter graph was being built. &amp;nbsp;I did a little looking and found that creating an instance of DsROTEntry with a reference to the graph makes it available for external viewing.</description>
