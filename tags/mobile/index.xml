      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=&#34;http://nebraskacode.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Nebraska.Code()&lt;/a&gt; is in the books and it was a real blast. The organizers, Adam &amp;amp; Ken, really put in the effort and run a great conference. The other speakers are always quality company and I really enjoyed meeting a few new ones and getting to know some much better. One of the things I enjoy about conference is the circle of friends you make and meet across the country as you travel to this conference and that conference. We had lots of deep, and many more entertaining conversations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was a pleasure to attend and speak at Nebraska.Code() this year. The guys in Lincoln are great and really put on a good conference. One of the neat parts of being a speaker is getting to know a lot of other great speakers as you go from one conference to another together. I&#39;ve found that as soon as one conference is over I&#39;m looking forward to the next one and the chance to hang out with the gang.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Xamarin Forms Windows Phone Deployment Tip #1</title>
      <link>https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/xamarin-forms-windows-phone-deployment-tip-1/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a helpful tip if you are developing a mobile app using Xamarin Forms and targeting Windows Phone 8.0 (or if you are just writing a WP8.0 Silverlight based app). If you are ready to deploy and filling everything out online it is easier than it first seems. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the Windows Phone Dev Center you will find a helpful link to &lt;a href=&#34;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn655122(v=vs.105).aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; telling you to add some info to the Package.appxmanifest.xml file. Only when you look at your project the file doesn’t exist. Searching will turn up little in the way of useful information. The problem is that these instructions are for Windows Phone Silverlight 8.1, which added the Package.appxmanifest.xml file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Getting your brand’s Twitter timeline in your mobile app</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m working on a demo app to show some simple functionality that can be done with Xamarin Forms. I’m using the opportunity to also make a business card app for myself (and ultimately for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alienarc.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Alien Arc&lt;/a&gt;). The app has my picture, name, short bio, and other relevant information. This also seemed like a good place to tie in some of my various social network feeds. I quickly added a page that pulls my blog RSS feed and lists my recent posts. That went really quick and next on my list was to load my twitter timeline and show recent tweets. The blog was so easy and quick to do that I thought it would take no time to get twitter integrated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
