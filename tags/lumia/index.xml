      <description>For those that purchased an unlocked Lumia 950 XL from Microsoft in the last few months and have been frustrated at the lack of Visual Voice (that’s everyone who bought one) you can rejoice. Last week I had sketchy WiFi access so I just discovered that I had an update available last night. When I went to take a look at the change log I discovered this little gem:&#xA;Support for Visual Voicemail on Dual SIM phones It sounds like this has been available in the Windows Insiders build for a little while, but I’ve been hesitant to put my primary phone on the insiders builds.</description>
