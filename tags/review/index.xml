To begin with, the flight there is long. We had two options, 45 minute layover to catch an international flight with all our luggage, or 5 hour layover waiting in the airport. We chose the later since no on wanted to miss a flight that only happens once a day and only on Saturday and Sunday each week. This turned out to be a good thing, simply because it gave us time to be out of airplane seats for a while as well as plenty of time to eat and no stress about missing a flight. Other than the length of the flight it was pleasant and smooth. We arrived in Bonaire early evening and the weather was amazing, the sun was on it&#39;s way down and there was a breeze that made the open air airport very comfortable. We waited a few minutes in a very short line to go through what was a very friendly customs check. I&#39;m told that the daytime arrival that some of our party had previously experienced consisted of a very long wait in the hot midday sunshine. After we got our luggage and exited the arrival area we found the bus for our resort, handed over our luggage again and climbed in for a quick ride to the resort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nebraska.Code() 2015 Retrospect</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was a pleasure to attend and speak at Nebraska.Code() this year. The guys in Lincoln are great and really put on a good conference. One of the neat parts of being a speaker is getting to know a lot of other great speakers as you go from one conference to another together. I&#39;ve found that as soon as one conference is over I&#39;m looking forward to the next one and the chance to hang out with the gang.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just picked up my Surface Pro from my local Microsoft Store this morning. I&amp;rsquo;m no stranger to Windows 8; I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it on my desktop since RTM (and a little before) and I bought the RT back on launch day. In general I like the changes that have been made and no longer feel at home on Windows 7. I have especially been digging the way the interface was built around touch with my RT, I think that has helped me accept some of the changes experienced with mouse and keyboard only input.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
