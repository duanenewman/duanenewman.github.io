      <title>Basic Authentication with TFS Package Server</title>
      <link>https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/2019-07-29-basic-auth-with-tfs-package-server/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently encountered some authentication issues connecting my Mac to the package service hosted on a client&amp;rsquo;s on-prem TFS server. The server is on a Windows domain and normally I access TFS from a windows VM that is joined to the domain. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve recently found myself on my Mac more often while working on one of their Xamarin mobile apps. This is when I began having problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The client has a couple NuGet packages hosted on the TFS server using the Package Management extension, and whenever I tried to do a NuGet restore I would run into authentication errors. I tried my normal domain user &amp;amp; password as well as a Personal Access Token (the method I wanted to use) and consistently was told my credentials were no good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Better Way to Override References With PackageReference</title>
      <link>https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/a-better-way-to-override-references-with-packagereference/</link>

      <guid>https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/a-better-way-to-override-references-with-packagereference/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, there was a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6949&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;new feature added&lt;/a&gt; to msbuild (working in Visual Studio 2019 15.9.9) that generates a variable for each package that contains the full path to the package version being used. All you have to do is add an attribute to each &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;PackageReference&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; you want need to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are just two changes to what we did &lt;a href=&#34;https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/forcing-a-specific-target-platform-with-packagereference&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;GeneratePathProperty&lt;/code&gt; attribute to &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;PackageReference&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch to &lt;code&gt;Pkg&amp;lt;Package_Name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; variable in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;HintPath&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step one is pretty simple, add the attribute &lt;code&gt;GeneratePathProperty&lt;/code&gt; with a value of &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Forcing a Specific Target Platform With PackageReference</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my last post about &lt;a href=&#34;../using-prism-with-xamarin-forms-and-gtk&#34;&gt;Using Prism with Xamarin.Forms &amp;amp; GTK#&lt;/a&gt; I showed how to force the use of .NET Standard reference when using NuGet with packages.config. You may prefer using the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;PackageReference&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag in your csproj and found that those changes do not work for your scenario. This post will show you how to achieve the same override with PackageReference based projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-package-reference&#34;&gt;Using Package Reference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;convertconfigtoreference2.png&#34; class=&#34;img-thumbnail pull-right&#34; alt=&#34;Convert Packages.config to PackageReference&#34; /&gt; If you already have packages installed and are using a &lt;code&gt;packages.config&lt;/code&gt; file then you will need to convert your project to use &lt;code&gt;PackageReference&lt;/code&gt;. You can follow the steps here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/migrate-packages-config-to-package-reference&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Migrate from packages.config to PackageReference&lt;/a&gt;. The short version is to right-click on &lt;code&gt;packages.config&lt;/code&gt; and select &lt;code&gt;Migrate Packages.config to PackageReference...&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Prism With Xamarin.Forms &amp; GTK</title>
      <link>https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/using-prism-with-xamarin-forms-and-gtk/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m working on project to replace my car radio with a custom digital dashboard. I&amp;rsquo;m building it on a RaspberryPi and would really like to use Xamarin.Forms and Prism, so I started out with adding a GTK# frontend to my Xamarin.Forms project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adding-the-gtk-backend-project&#34;&gt;Adding the GTK# Backend Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we can add the GTK# project we need to actually install the GTK# libraries. Head over to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-win&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Mono Project&lt;/a&gt; to download and run the GTK# for .NET installer for Windows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Running PowerShell Scripts From C#</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the little things can trip up your code, even when you think you are doing all the right things. We recently ran into an issue with a utility that runs an included PowerShell script as part of it operation. When the app was first put into use it seemed to be fine. Recently, it was deployed into a folder with spaces in the name and it began to blow up. Here is a simplified example of what it was running:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Concurrent Reads and Locked Writes with In-Memory Objects</title>
      <link>https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/concurrent-reads-and-locked-writes-with-in-memory-objects/</link>

      <guid>https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/concurrent-reads-and-locked-writes-with-in-memory-objects/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a recent project one of our clients had implemented an in-memory cache of some high read, low write data. The ultimate solution they had was a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that they could search against while periodically updating when the database was updated. The reads worked great and were incredibly fast. The trouble came when they started to implement the updates. This was in their API layer and so incoming calls were on multiple threads. The multi-threading was perfect for reading, but as soon as they started updating the collection (or any sub-collections on the individual items involved in queries) they, unsurprisingly, started getting &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.invalidoperationexception&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;InvalidOperationExceptions&lt;/a&gt; with the message &amp;ldquo;Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Keeping Observable Collections Up To Date</title>
      <link>https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/keeping-observable-collections-up-to-date/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the powerful capabilities we&amp;rsquo;ve learned to leverage when using the MVVM pattern for XAML based apps, whether for the desktop or mobile platforms, is data binding. Binding allows us to easily keep our View up to date with changes in the ViewModel. These bindings are typically pretty quick when not abused, but there are situations where they can become less than performant, causing visual anomalies such as flickering or even impacting general app performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Better Unit Testing with IoC, DI, and Mocking</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you write code designed for dependency injection it can make testing easier.. But it can also make it seem more complex and add a lot of ceremony to creating your testable instances. I thought I would share some tips I use when setting up a new cross-platform mobile project with unit testing. We can take advantage of the same IoC container strategy to make instantiating the class we want to test less painful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Extension methods are a great way to add functionality or integration for established types. Learn about some of the cool things that you can do without the need to subclass or modify a class directly. You can even use extension methods to supply specialized functionality that is only relevant in a particular situation or when also making use of another type or library. We&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at a few quick tricks and explore how you can get started with Extension Methods today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>All I want for Christmas is a C# Build System</title>

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://crosscuttingconcerns.com/The-First-C-Advent-Calendar&#34;&gt;The First C# Advent Calendar&lt;/a&gt;, celebrating all things C#. After you finish here check out the other great posts in the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-c-build-system&#34;&gt;A C# Build System&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used many tools over the years to manage builds of large .NET projects including custom BAT/CMD files, customer PowerShell scripts, NAnt, and of course MSBuild. While I&amp;rsquo;ve been happy with the solutions I provided with each of these I&amp;rsquo;ve always found them either awkward to extend or limiting in their extensibility and more recently I needed them to work on a Mac for building Xamarin projects. In the hunt to find something that would work outside of Windows I discovered &lt;a href=&#34;https://cakebuild.net/&#34;&gt;Cake&lt;/a&gt;, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a little time today to work on Bluff, my extension for Sony Vegas Pro. Over the last couple weeks I’ve done several things to the project, including:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Converting the project to .NET 3.5 (from 2.0) &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Converting the UI to WPF (still a little cleanup to do on that UI, but it is a lot easier to work with now) &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Add a new command called &lt;em&gt;Arrange Events By Created Timestamp&lt;/em&gt; that spaces the events out on the timeline relative to each others created timestamp &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Changed the Vegas DLL reference to a v8 dll (to provide better compatibility form Vegas Pro 8 – 13) &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;And last, but not least, I added a WIX based installer to the project &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you just want grab the latest version jump over to the GitHub release page.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was out of active Xamarin development for a couple months and recently wanted to jump back in and work on a couple new project ideas. I fired up VS2015 and created a project. It was then that I realized I had not installed the official Xamarin tools since I got my new Surface Book. So I decided it was a good idea to install that latest Xamarin Tools before I did anything else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, my business Alien Arc Technologies, LLC &lt;a title=&#34;Alien Arc Technologies, LLC Announces Bluff, an OSS Project for Sony Vegas Pro&#34; href=&#34;http://alienarc.com/post/announcing-new-oss-project-bluff-for-vegas-pro-12&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the release of version 1.0 of an open source project I’ve been tinkering on recently, called Bluff. This is my first OSS project and I’m excited to have created something that I hope others will find useful, and better yet, will contribute their own ideas to.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3&gt;History&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The project came out of my own personal needs and interest. In 2015 I was introduced to the world of scuba diving and I’ve fallen totally in love with it. It didn’t take long before I was combining scuba with my photography hobby.. And suddenly I found I had the perfect environment to do video. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Xamarin Forms Windows Phone Deployment Tip #1</title>
      <link>https://duanenewman.net/blog/post/xamarin-forms-windows-phone-deployment-tip-1/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a helpful tip if you are developing a mobile app using Xamarin Forms and targeting Windows Phone 8.0 (or if you are just writing a WP8.0 Silverlight based app). If you are ready to deploy and filling everything out online it is easier than it first seems. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the Windows Phone Dev Center you will find a helpful link to &lt;a href=&#34;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn655122(v=vs.105).aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; telling you to add some info to the Package.appxmanifest.xml file. Only when you look at your project the file doesn’t exist. Searching will turn up little in the way of useful information. The problem is that these instructions are for Windows Phone Silverlight 8.1, which added the Package.appxmanifest.xml file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m working on a demo app to show some simple functionality that can be done with Xamarin Forms. I’m using the opportunity to also make a business card app for myself (and ultimately for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alienarc.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Alien Arc&lt;/a&gt;). The app has my picture, name, short bio, and other relevant information. This also seemed like a good place to tie in some of my various social network feeds. I quickly added a page that pulls my blog RSS feed and lists my recent posts. That went really quick and next on my list was to load my twitter timeline and show recent tweets. The blog was so easy and quick to do that I thought it would take no time to get twitter integrated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why doesn’t my code work in Xamarin.Forms?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have tried something in Xamarin.Forms that should work but didn&amp;rsquo;t, don&amp;rsquo;t worry you might not be going crazy (I can&amp;rsquo;t say for sure, I&amp;rsquo;m a programmer, not a psychologist).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been diving deeper into Xamarin.Forms over the last couple months while working on a small project we have as well as in preparation for my upcoming talk at St. Louis Days of .NET. &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes in the course of creating a sample project I write some code that I know should work and then watch the exceptions pop-up (or worse, see nothing at all) when I run it. Then I go do a quick search and find that this is a known issue&amp;hellip; and that it has been fixed. That is when I remember that I didn&amp;rsquo;t update my Xamarin.Forms nuget packages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Processing collections with LINQ using the Aggregate extension method</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows one of the easiest ways to process collections of objects is using foreach, it is much more elegant and less error prone (IMHO) than using a for (int x..) and looping by index. &amp;nbsp;However, sometimes you get forced into using the indexer to process a collection. &amp;nbsp;This usually happens when you need to look at the current object in context of the previous. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need to use the indexer and have code like obj[i] == obj[i -1] bugged me. I spent a little time digging into the LINQ extensions to see if anything could help. &amp;nbsp;Then i stumbled upon an explanation of the various aggregation methods that got me thinking. &amp;nbsp;After a little play time in Linq Pad I had a working solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Attaching to external DirectShow graphs using Graph Edit</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my day job I work on a product that does a lot of video work and in fact has a custom DirectShow player that gets all our video into WPF. &amp;nbsp;It plays multiple files all synchronized (a real challenge).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While looking into ways to improve performance I found myself needing to see how my filter graph was being built. &amp;nbsp;I did a little looking and found that creating an instance of DsROTEntry with a reference to the graph makes it available for external viewing. The code is really quite simple:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
