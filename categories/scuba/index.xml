      <title>Diving in Bonaire - 2016</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;asside-left&#34; style=&#34;text-align:center;width:auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://duanenewman.net/img/posts/WeHaveLanded.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img title=&#34;WeHaveLanded&#34; style=&#34;border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;WeHaveLanded&#34; src=&#34;https://duanenewman.net/img/posts/WeHaveLanded_thumb.jpg&#34; width=&#34;244&#34; height=&#34;136&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I decided to take a few minutes and reflect on my recent trip to Bonaire and share some accomplishments and observations. To begin with, the flight there is long. We had two options, 45 minute layover to catch an international flight with all our luggage, or 5 hour layover waiting in the airport. We chose the later since no on wanted to miss a flight that only happens once a day and only on Saturday and Sunday each week. This turned out to be a good thing, simply because it gave us time to be out of airplane seats for a while as well as plenty of time to eat and no stress about missing a flight. Other than the length of the flight it was pleasant and smooth. We arrived in Bonaire early evening and the weather was amazing, the sun was on it&#39;s way down and there was a breeze that made the open air airport very comfortable. We waited a few minutes in a very short line to go through what was a very friendly customs check. I&#39;m told that the daytime arrival that some of our party had previously experienced consisted of a very long wait in the hot midday sunshine. After we got our luggage and exited the arrival area we found the bus for our resort, handed over our luggage again and climbed in for a quick ride to the resort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Sure, I don’t have years and hundreds of dives to compare it to, but the reefs were healthy, the fish were plentiful and there were wrecks, swimthroughs and plenty of deep diving. They are very aggressive about controlling or removing the invasive Lionfish population and encourage you to spearfish them if desired. Several of the group were interested and the guides taught each of them to safely use the Hawaiian sling. The population is under much better control than it used to be and you had to actually hunt for the Lionfish, but everyone that went in with a spear came out with a Lionfish at least once.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

To summarize, the place is amazing! As I mentioned, it sit atop Dunbar Rock, a massive rock structure protruding from the bay waters. The Villa itself is quite large and the main living spaces are about 3 flights of stairs up from the dock. There is also a ramp the rises around 3 sides of the rock to allow handicap access and a give a nice covered area to stroll and view of the ocean waters all around you. The Villa is staffed with very pleasant and professional staff, but by the time we left they felt more like family than just our staff. We laughed and had fun together, and all the while they were taking care of our every need. The food and Chef Manuel were excellent. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;img style=&#34;float:right;margin-left:5px;&#34; src=&#34;https://duanenewman.net/blog/image.axd?picture=%2f2016%2f04%2fGuanajaAirplane.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were traveling from cold weather to warm weather, so we planned ahead and packed shorts in our carry-on so that while we stopped for a layover in Atlanta we could change out of our warmer weather pants. This worked out really well and I recommend this to anyone traveling under similar conditions. I’m a tall (and big) guy, so we upgraded our seats to the comfort+ (or whatever they called it) package so my knees wouldn’t be shoved in the back of a seat for 2-3 hours at a time. As a tall guy, it was totally worth it. It’s just too bad that doesn’t do anything for the width of the seat… I still felt a little packed in, but my budget is far from getting first class tickets. The most interesting part of our travels was between Roatan and Guanaja. Landing in Roatan and going through customs wasn’t bad. It took a while for the line to move, but we spent more time waiting on luggage then going through customs. Eventually we got our bags and headed over to check in for our puddle-jumper flight over to Guanaja. So we got to the “terminal” grabbed some food and waited.. and waited.. and waited.. I think we finally boarded about a half hour after our posted flight departure time. The ride over was fun, in a a little ~20 seater and took about 20 minutes from tarmac to “tarmac.” The little airport at Guanaja was part of the charm of the trip and as a first time small island visitor, it looked just like it is depicted in all the movies, barely there. The airport was actually a nice little building and was even air-conditioned (important for the return trip).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Traveling with your photography equipment can be challenging when you are taking all your pictures on dry (or at least solid) ground. Add all the equipment you need if you are going to get wet with you camera and it becomes a production just getting it all to your destination. When I first looked into what to do I had a hard time finding information on what other were doing, so I hope you find this helpful as you plan your underwater photography dive trip.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In January my wife and I took our first real scuba diving vacation with our dive shop, The Playground Dive Shop, to the island of Guanaja, Honduras where we stayed and dived with the Villa on Dunbar Rock. We were excited about have a week dedicated getting some good bottom time. Having just been introduced to scuba less than 1 year earlier we had only logged a total of 20 dives, 4 of those dives were the ocean in Hawaii and the other 16 where all lake dives, and most of them were check-out dives for our Open Water, Advanced and a few specialty certifications. This trip promised to nearly double our total number of dives and at least quadruple our ocean dives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
