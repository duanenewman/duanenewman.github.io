This is the challenge we found ourselves faced with a few months into operating Alien Arc.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h5&gt;Enter Aglie&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We started a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.Trello.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; board back when we started the business to track tasks like getting our insurance setup and creating a logo. But when we got done with many of those we stopped using the board and focused on making money. Recently we decided that we needed to start making progress on other business goals and we did three things: &lt;/p&gt;</description>
