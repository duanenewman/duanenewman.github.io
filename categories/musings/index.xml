      <description>When Brent and I started Alien Arc we had a few basic goals:
 To have more flexible working conditions To be more active with the developer community and conferences To create our own products  We&amp;rsquo;ve done a pretty good job in our first 6 months getting started on some of these goals. We are on-site with our primary client, but they are closer and with the consultant relationship it is much easier to deal with any needs for a flexible schedule.</description>
